    <!-- My Bio Text -->
                        <p>My name is <b>Colton Arlin Scherer</b> and I am an aspiring 
                            computer programmer. I took an intro to computer 
                            science course in college, where I worked with C++.
                            From then on I wanted to learn more about programming.
                            From working at a software company as an accountant, I 
                            saw web development as an important coding base to know
                            in an evolving SAAS and app based business environment.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> I graduated in December 2014 from Hamline University with a Bachelors 
                            Degree in Business Administration, majoring in Accounting. After college, 
                            I worked for a software company from February 2015 to November 2017 as an accountant.
                            I used my knowledge of coding practices to create unique excel spreadsheets
                            that would help automate and speed up the processes that I was tasked with. 
                            I was often an excel-guru for various teams to help them do the same within 
                            their own departments. I eventually delved into excels VBA developer module 
                            and I started to ask myself if I should be tyring to learn a real coding languages 
                            vs using a spreadsheet tool. Working for the company heightened my interest 
                            in software development even more, as the people I met were very interesting 
                            and I related with immensely. After finding accounting work outside of a software 
                            environment, I knew I really wanted to get back to that type of work-life as it was 
                            more challenging and interesting to me as well.
